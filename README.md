# HackDuke-Project
StudyBuddy Webpage created for the 2020 Fall HackDuke competition. Webpage contributors include Erin Byrd, Nicholas Carter, and Albert Demarco. The webpage consists of the
following study tools: 
  1. Zoom Link Sharing is a tool that allows users to send a Zoom link to their study partners' emails all from one place.
  2. The Pomodoro Timer provides users with a time management tool that encourages them to work through large projects in an efficient method. The Pomodoro Method consists of 4 
     25-minute work intervals seperated by five minute breaks.
  3. The Study Tips tool provides users with randomized tips that may help them with everyday school activities.
  4. Quick Translate is a tool that allows users to input foreign text, the language that text is in, and the language they want to translate that text to, all while never having 
     to leave the page.
  5. WikiSpeedia provides users with the ability to input a topic they would like to learn more about, and displays a short summary of that topic from Wikipeedia.

The files uploaded here only include the webpage layout and Pomodoro Timer.
